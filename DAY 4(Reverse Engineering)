X86_64 Assembly - Common Terms
  Heap --Memory that can be allocated and deallocated
**Stack --A contiguous section of memory used for passing arguments
  General Register --A multipurpose register that can be used by either programmer or user to store data or a memory location address
  Control Register --A processor register that changes or controls the behavior of a CPU
  Flags Register --Contains the current state of the processor

X86_64 Assembly
  There are 16 general purpose 64-Bit registers
%rax --The first return register
%rbp --The base pointer that keeps track of the base of the stack
%rsp --The stack pointer that points to the top of the stack

X86_64 Assembly - Memory Offset
There is one instruction pointer register that points to the memory offset of the next instruction in the code segment
64-Bit |||| Lower 32 bits |||| Lower 16 bits |||| Descrition
RIP    ||||      EIP      ||||       IP      |||| Instruction Pointer; holds address for next instruction to be executed

X86_64 Assembly - Common Instructions
MOV  || Move source to destination
PUSH || Push source onto stack
POP  || Pop top of stack to destination
INC  || Increment source by 1
DEC  || Decrement source by 1
ADD  || Add source to destination
SUB  || Subtract source from destination
CMP  || Compare 2 values by subtracting them and setting the %RFLAGS register. ZeroFlag set means they are the same.
JMP  || Jump to specified location
JLE  || Jump if less than or equal
JE   || Jump if equal
RET  || If theres nothing specified it returns the content of the first return registry(rax)
Stack 
--First in=Last out 

Reverse Engineering Workflow (Software)
  Static       ||| Find plain text ascii and unicode strings
  Behavioral   ||| Take a snapshot of critical configurations of the analysis environment
  Dynamic      ||| Execute binary in a debugger
  Disassembly  ||| Disassemble binary in IDA, Ghidra, or other disassembler
