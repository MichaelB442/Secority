Buffer Overflow Terms 
  Heap || Memory that can be allocated and deallocated
  Stack || A contiguous section of memory used for passing arguments
  Registers || Storage elements as close as possible to the central processing unit (CPU)
  Instruction Pointer (IP) || a.k.a Program Counter (PC), contains the address of next instruction to be executed
  Stack Pointer (SP) || Contains the address of the next available space on the stack
  Base Pointer (BP) || The base of the stack
  Function || Code that is separate from the main program that is often used to replace code the repeats in order to make the program smaller and more efficient
  Shellcode || The code that is executed once an exploit successfully takes advantage of a vulnerability

Buffer Overflow Defenses
  Non executable (NX) stack
  Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) -- randomize the location so it cant all be over written
  Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
  Stack Canaries -- randomized numbers in the stack that when overwritten halt the executable
  Position Independent Executable (PIE)

Tools
  IDA, GHIDRA
  GDB, MONA, IMMUNITY
  BASH, PYTHON

GDB
disass -- disassemble a portion of a program
x/256c $<register> read characters from specific register
break <address> establish a break point
